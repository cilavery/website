    <p>
	Just finished Chapter 5 of Ruby on Rails Tutorial by Michael Hartl. Following everything step by step and everything is going smoothly so far. My only nagging fear is, "I'm just following the steps." How will I know what to do when it's just me and a computer?<br>

	This is when I need to step back and relax. I need to remember these rules:
</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The brain makes connections unconsciously. Even if I feel like I'm not retaining anything, the brain is learning.</li>
		<li>Stop overthinking</li>
		<li>I actually like what I'm learning and it takes time! Smart people don't give up.</li>

	</ul>		

	<p>
	Some cool things I've learned so far (in my conscious brain) from the book: 
	<ul>
		<li>SASS is cool. I even thought it was awesome, before I looked it up and saw that it stood for AWESOME</li>

	</ul>
